# Neighbourhood-Skill-Exchange-Platform
Neighborhood Skill Exchange is a Java Swing desktop application that helps people in the same locality exchange skills without money. Users register, add skills they can offer and skills they need, and the app matches them with compatible neighbors using a simple matching algorithm and file-based storage.
